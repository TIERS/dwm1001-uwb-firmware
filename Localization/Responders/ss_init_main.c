*  @brief   Single-sided two-way ranging (SS TWR) initiator example code
*
*           This is a simple code example which acts as the initiator in a SS TWR distance measurement exchange. This application sends a "poll"
*           frame (recording the TX time-stamp of the poll), after which it waits for a "response" message from the "DS TWR responder" example
*           code (companion to this application) to complete the exchange. The response message contains the remote responder's time-stamps of poll
*           RX, and response TX. With this data and the local time-stamps, (of poll TX and response RX), this example application works out a value
*           for the time-of-flight over-the-air and, thus, the estimated distance between the two devices, which it writes to the LCD.
*
*
*           Notes at the end of this file, expand on the inline comments.
*				
* 			This code is for TAG LOCALIZATION, it is based on decawave's code SS TWR example. It is designed to be flashed inside the anchors in the network.
*			The anchors act as responders by replying to the poll messages sent by the initiator with response messages containing time-stamps of RX and TX as 
*			explained above.

        POLL_RX_TO_RESP_TX_DLY_UUS is a critical value for porting to different processors. 
        For slower platforms where the SPI is at a slower speed or the processor is operating at a lower 
        frequency (Comparing to STM32F, SPI of 18MHz and Processor internal 72MHz)this value needs to be increased.
        Knowing the exact time when the responder is going to send its response is vital for time of flight 
        calculation. The specification of the time of respnse must allow the processor enough time to do its 
        calculations and put the packet in the Tx buffer. So more time is required for a slower system(processor).

/*****************************************************************************************************************************************************
* NOTES:
*
* 1. The frames used here are Decawave specific ranging frames, complying with the IEEE 802.15.4 standard data frame encoding. The frames are the
*    following:
*     - a poll message sent by the initiator to trigger the ranging exchange.
*     - a response message sent by the responder to complete the exchange and provide all information needed by the initiator to compute the
*       time-of-flight (distance) estimate.
*    The first 10 bytes of those frame are common and are composed of the following fields:
*     - byte 0/1: frame control (0x8841 to indicate a data frame using 16-bit addressing).
*     - byte 2: sequence number, incremented for each new frame.
*     - byte 3/4: PAN ID (0xDECA).
*     - byte 5/6: destination address, see NOTE 2 below.
*     - byte 7/8: source address, see NOTE 2 below.
*     - byte 9: function code (specific values to indicate which message it is in the ranging process).
*    The remaining bytes are specific to each message as follows:
*    Poll message:
*     - no more data
*    Response message:
*     - byte 10 -> 13: poll message reception timestamp.
*     - byte 14 -> 17: response message transmission timestamp.
*    All messages end with a 2-byte checksum automatically set by DW1000.
* 2. Source and destination addresses are hard coded constants in this example to keep it simple but for a real product every device should have a
*    unique ID. Here, 16-bit addressing is used to keep the messages as short as possible but, in an actual application, this should be done only
*    after an exchange of specific messages used to define those short addresses for each device participating to the ranging exchange.
* 3. dwt_writetxdata() takes the full size of the message as a parameter but only copies (size - 2) bytes as the check-sum at the end of the frame is
*    automatically appended by the DW1000. This means that our variable could be two bytes shorter without losing any data (but the sizeof would not
*    work anymore then as we would still have to indicate the full length of the frame to dwt_writetxdata()).
* 4. We use polled mode of operation here to keep the example as simple as possible but all status events can be used to generate interrupts. Please
*    refer to DW1000 User Manual for more details on "interrupts". It is also to be noted that STATUS register is 5 bytes long but, as the event we
*    use are all in the first bytes of the register, we can use the simple dwt_read32bitreg() API call to access it instead of reading the whole 5
*    bytes.
* 5. The high order byte of each 40-bit time-stamps is discarded here. This is acceptable as, on each device, those time-stamps are not separated by
*    more than 2**32 device time units (which is around 67 ms) which means that the calculation of the round-trip delays can be handled by a 32-bit
*    subtraction.
* 6. The user is referred to DecaRanging ARM application (distributed with EVK1000 product) for additional practical example of usage, and to the
*     DW1000 API Guide for more details on the DW1000 driver functions.
* 7. The use of the carrier integrator value to correct the TOF calculation, was added Feb 2017 for v1.3 of this example.  This significantly
*     improves the result of the SS-TWR where the remote responder unit's clock is a number of PPM offset from the local inmitiator unit's clock.
*     As stated in NOTE 2 a fixed offset in range will be seen unless the antenna delsy is calibratred and set correctly.
